Acccessible here: https://moel6746.dima358.com

A series of four short exercises are included.

The midterm [portfolio](https://moel6746.dima358.com/portfolio) is a personal website complete with a resume and projects. It was created to resemble 8-bit video games and/or a terminal. 

The [final project](https://moel6746.dima358.com/final), focuses on sustainability with my topic being Community Gardens. The website uses the [Trefle API](https://docs.trefle.io/) to provide users plant recommendations for creating their own community gardens based on zone, light, conditions, etc.
