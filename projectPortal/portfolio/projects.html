                <h3>Driver Monitoring System</h3>
                <p>The goal of the proposed system was to monitor and identify inattentiveness and drowsiness in drivers
                    by
                    way of electromyography (EMG) to monitor eye blink rate, electroencephalography (EEG) to monitor
                    brain
                    activity, and electrocardiography (ECG) signals to monitor heart rate. Through this research it was
                    determined that single-channel EEG from the channel F7 electrode, placed near the temple above the
                    frontal lobe, was a suitable and convenient location for determining drowsiness and alertness in
                    drivers, producing an average accuracy of 67.378%. From the observed data it was possible to locate
                    and
                    identify decernable patterns indicative of drowsy and alert states in the F7 channel. These results
                    furthered the goal of creating an accessible, non-invasive, compact system able to automatically
                    detect
                    distracted and drowsy driving to act as a warning system, alerting users of inattentive and
                    dangerous
                    behavior.</p>

                <h3>Wearable Posture Monitoring System</h3>
                <p>The goal of the proposed system was to automatically track a user's postural positions throughout the
                    day
                    through the use of a non-invasive, wearable system and automatically provide feedback to change
                    their
                    posture. This was done by placing magnets in the form of a rectangular grid on a shirt as well as an
                    MMR
                    sensor on the chest of the body. The onboard magnetic sensor records the data values from the grid
                    of
                    magnetics, which is then, along with data recorded from the onboard accelerometer, analyzed to
                    determine
                    the position of the user. A trained algorithm recognizes and automatically detects the spinal
                    position
                    of the user from the recorded data points and provides direction to alter posture. These
                    recommendations
                    act as a warning system and allow the user to self-monitor to prevent back and neck pain and reduce
                    the
                    chance of long-lasting damage that can result from poor posture.</p>
