            <p>The Game Boy Advance SP (GBA SP) is a sixth-generation
                handheld game console developed, released, and marketed by Nintendo that served as an upgraded version
                of
                the original Game Boy Advance. The "SP" in the name stands for "Special". It is the penultimate console
                in the Game Boy Advance product line before the Game Boy Micro, which was released in September 2005.
            </p>

            <h2 id="ags-101">Backlit model (AGS-101)</h2>
            <p>In 2005, Nintendo released an improved version of the Game Boy Advance SP in North America, featuring a
                brighter backlit screen instead of the previous version's frontlit screen. This GBA SP was Nintendo's
                first
                internationally-released handheld system to feature an integrated backlight. (However, there had already
                been a backlit system years earlier with the Japan-only Game Boy Light, which was essentially a Game Boy
                Pocket with an electroluminescent backlit display.) The AGS-101 was never officially released in Japan,
                however, as the frontlit AGS-001 models were still available on the market until the end of production.
            </p>

            <aside>The AGS-101 Game Boy Advance SP was the final Nintendo handheld to have backward compatibility with
                Game
                Boy and Game Boy Color games in North America and Europe.</aside>

            <p>The new model can be distinguished by the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>The box states "Now with a BRIGHTER backlit screen!" to distinguish the new model from the older,
                    frontlit models.</li>
                <li>The model number of the backlit SP is AGS-101, whereas the model number of the original frontlit SP
                    is
                    AGS-001. This can be found on the label at the bottom of the unit.</li>
                <li>The mini button at the top center of the console's lower face is now referred to in the manual as
                    the
                    "Brightness Switch" and selects between two levels of brightness, "Normal" (Low) and "Bright" (High)
                    with no off setting. On the frontlit models this button turned the frontlight on or off only. With
                    the
                    backlight set to "Normal" (Low) the brightness still surpasses the original AGS-001 with the
                    frontlight
                    on.</li>
                <li>When powered off, the backlit model's screen is completely black, but the frontlit model's screen is
                    noticeably lighter.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="reception">Reception and Sales</h2>
            <p>M. Wiley of IGN called the Game Boy Advance SP "a step in the right direction for Nintendo", praising the
                system's new redesign over the original GBA and highlighting its inclusion of a backlit screen and
                rechargeable battery, although minor criticism went towards the system's omission of a headphone jack.
                Engadget gave it a global score of 84 out of 100, also praising the new features of the redesign while
                noting the system's lack of a headphone jack. Lawson Wong of Fresh Gear called it "darn close to
                perfection" aside from the missing headphone jack. Matthew D. Sarrel of PC Magazine suggested it to
                consumers as an improvement over the original model, praising the backlight and integration of a charger
                as
                well as improved visual quality, though he noted that players with larger hands may find difficulty with
                the
                system's design.</p>
            <p>As of June 30, 2009, the Game Boy Advance series has sold 81.48 million units worldwide, of which 43.52
                million are Game Boy Advance SP units.</p>
